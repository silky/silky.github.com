title: You Have Already Accomplished Everything

You were born, cried, learned, made friends, and talked to no-one.

You have survived off the land; launched a startup (the best one), managed
thousands of people, and never been able to get a job, no matter what your
resume says or how you change your name.

You have travelled; and you have lived alone, isolated, and cold.

You have been the best and succeeded all your life.

You have failed; only, just missed out, and never tried again.

You made people happy; shown them the best time, given them everything, and
hurt them, taken it all for yourself, and killed them.

You have died after every breath, and before your first.

You have already accomplished everything.

What do you want to do next?
