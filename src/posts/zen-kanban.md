We are all familiar with the standard kanban/agile board settings:

- Backlog: Things we're ignoring for now
- Todo: Stuff we've got to do this "sprint"
- In progress: Stuff we're working on now
- Done
- Blocked

There are many variants on these names, but they've remained pretty standard
over all the organisations I've worked in.

I myself now prefer a buddhist-inspired variant; namely:

- Background (was: `backlog`): Items floating in the expanse of consciousness.
- Awareness (was: `todo`): Items present in the mind.
- Sparking joy (was: `in progress`): Items presently being enjoyed directly.
- Thank you (was `done`): Items that have passed their time with us, for now.
- Impermanence (was `blocked`): Items temporarily on hold.

It at least lets me feel more relaxed about almost every column :)
