<p>Due to the release of (yet another) Python framework for quantum simulation
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ProjectQ">ProjectQ</a>, I was inspired to revisit the
paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1507">An adaptive attack on Wiesner’s quantum
money</a> from a few years back.</p>
<p>This post will form the first post of a three-part series on the paper, and
the background necessary to understand the part of it I’ll cover. We’ll
learn about:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="#">Wiesner’s scheme for quantum money, and why it was considered secure</a>
(this post),</li>
<li>An attack on Wiesner’s money scheme that shows it is not secure (with an
aside into quantum bomb testing!),</li>
<li>and, A modification of Wiesner’s scheme that resists this attack.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h1 id="wiesners-scheme">Wiesner’s scheme</h1>
<p>Wiesner’s Quantum Money scheme is one of the earliest ideas in quantum
computing. The fundamental idea is that (unknown) quantum states <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem">cannot
be copied arbitrarily</a> and
hence make an “unforgable” form of money: it shouldn’t be possible to
duplicate a “quantum” bill.</p>
<p>Money, in Wiesner’s scheme, is created by the bank. The bank holds a serial
number and a secret “key” that the bank uses to verify each note that it hands
out. When given a note, the bank can determine if it is valid by referring
back to this secret key.</p>
<p>The important steps are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Money generation</strong>: Done by the bank here; the bank creates money by
randomly picking a quantum state, call it <span class="math inline">|$⟩</span>, and handing that
state to the customer, and recording the state it generated by matching it
to the serial number of the note.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Money verification</strong>: When someone wishes to spend money, the bank
verifies it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s take a look in detail. We’ll first need to recall some standard quantum
states:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$ \begin{aligned}
    |0\rangle &amp;= \left( \begin{array}{c}
        1 \\ 0
    \end{array} \right), \\
    |1\rangle &amp;= \left( \begin{array}{c}
        0 \\ 1
    \end{array} \right), \\
    |+\rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |0\rangle + |1\rangle \right), \\
    |-\rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |0\rangle - |1\rangle \right).
\end{aligned} $$</span></p>
<p>The first two states, <span class="math inline">{|0⟩,|1⟩}</span> form a <em>basis</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> – the
<em>computational</em> basis – for a single qubit, and the second two, <span class="math inline">{|+⟩,| − ⟩}</span> form a different, orthogonal, basis – the <em>Hadamard</em> basis.</p>
<p>The crucial idea to understanding the scheme is that in quantum mechanics,
<em>measurement</em> can irreversibly destroy a given quantum state, changing it
to be a completely different one.</p>
<h2 id="measurement">Measurement</h2>
<p>To <em>measure</em> a given state in quantum mechanics is to first fix a set of
potential measurement outcomes, and then “look” at the given state, and see
which one of these outcomes the state when in. Let’s see an example.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a single qubit in some unknown state:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$ \begin{aligned}
    |\psi\rangle &amp;= \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle
\end{aligned} $$</span></p>
<p>We can <em>measure</em> the qubit in either the <em>computational</em> basis or the
<em>Hadamard</em> basis.</p>
<p><strong>Computational basis</strong>.
Noting that it is already express in <em>terms</em> of the computationl basis, if we
measure it in the computational basis, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule">Born
rule</a> for measurement says that we
will get the state <span class="math inline">|0⟩</span> with probabily <span class="math inline">|<em>α</em>|<sup>2</sup></span> and the state
<span class="math inline">|1⟩</span> with probabily <span class="math inline">|<em>β</em>|<sup>2</sup></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Hadamard basis</strong>: Note that <span class="math inline">$|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+\rangle + |-\rangle \right)$</span> and <span class="math inline">$|1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(|+\rangle - |-\rangle \right)$</span> so we can re-write <span class="math inline">|<em>ψ</em>⟩</span> as
<span class="math display">$$ \begin{aligned}
    |\psi\rangle &amp;= \frac{\alpha + \beta}{\sqrt{2}} |+\rangle + 
                    \frac{\alpha - \beta}{\sqrt{2}} |-\rangle
\end{aligned} $$</span>
and so, again by the Born rule, we would achieve outcome <span class="math inline">| + ⟩</span> with
probability <span class="math inline">$\left|\frac{\alpha + \beta}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2$</span> and <span class="math inline">| − ⟩</span>
with probability <span class="math inline">$\left|\frac{\alpha - \beta}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2$</span>.</p>
<p>The point to note here is that the final state is <em>different</em> depending on
which basis we measured it in. Wiesner used this fact to build a (hopefully)
unforgable form of money.</p>
<h2 id="wiesners-quantum-money">Wiesner’s quantum money</h2>
<p><strong>Money generation</strong>: To withdraw money from a bank in Wiesner’s scheme, the
bank performs the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Pick a serial number, <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span>,</li>
<li>Pick <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> states at random from <span class="math inline">|0⟩,|1⟩, |+⟩,| − ⟩</span>, call this the <em>key</em> and save these choices in a database linked
to the serial number.</li>
<li>Build a quantum state from these basis elements, and call the combined
state <span class="math inline">|$⟩</span>.</li>
<li>Yield a bank note to the customer with the given serial number <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and
the embedded quantum state <span class="math inline">|$⟩</span>.</li>
</ol>
<center>
<img src="../images/quantum-money-withdrawal.png" width="100%" />
</center>
<p><strong>Money verification</strong>: To verify a given piece of money, the bank proceeds
as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Look up the key for the provided serial number <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span>,</li>
<li>Measure each qubit in the basis that the we know it was created from.</li>
<li>If the money state hasn’t changed, then we will measure it
to be in the same state that we created it, and we can say
that it is valid.
<center>
<img src="../images/quantum-money-spend-valid.png" width="100%" />
</center></li>
<li>If the money state <em>has</em> changed, then there is a chance that the
measurement results will disagree, and we can be sure that it has
been tampered with.
<center>
<img src="../images/quantum-money-spend-invalid.png" width="100%" />
</center></li>
<li>In the case that validation succeeds, the money state is returned to the
person requesting validation, and in the case that the validation fails,
the money is destroyed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having the <em>same</em> money state returned, instead of a new one each time
validation succeeds, is critical to the success of the forging approach of
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1507v4.pdf">arXiv:1404.1507</a>.</p>
<h2 id="standard-analysis-of-wiesners-scheme">Standard analysis of Wiesner’s scheme</h2>
<p>Let’s look at an example. Suppose we have withdrawn some money from the bank,
and the state we’ve been given (but can’t see) is</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$ \begin{aligned}
    |\$\rangle &amp;= |+100--\rangle.
\end{aligned} $$</span></p>
<p>There are six qubits, and <em>we</em> can see the bases that each has been prepared
in, but if we’re simply the customer we don’t know this information.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create a state <span class="math inline">|<em>F</em>⟩</span> that the bank will <em>also</em> verify as
valid.</p>
<p>Noting that if we measure either <span class="math inline">| + ⟩</span> or <span class="math inline">| − ⟩</span> in the
computational basis, we’ll get <span class="math inline">|0⟩</span> with 50% probability or
<span class="math inline">|1⟩</span> with 50% probability, one approach is simply to build <span class="math inline">|<em>F</em>⟩</span>
by the following technique:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Measure each qubit indepnedently in the <em>computational basis</em>, and obtain
some measurement outcome <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> ∈ {0, 1}</span>.</li>
<li>In this way, build up <span class="math inline">|<em>F</em>⟩</span> from states <span class="math inline">|<em>x</em>⟩</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In our example, we can see that this will work 50% of the time for the first
qubit of <span class="math inline">|$⟩</span>, 100% of the time for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th qubits, and
again 50% of the time for the last two qubits. So for this state, this
approach will succeed with probability <span class="math inline">$\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}$</span>. Pretty bad odds.</p>
<p>In an earlier paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.4010.pdf">Molina Vidick and
Watrous</a> show that in a model where the
attacker <em>doesn’t</em> interact with the bank after receiving the note, the best
attack that one can mount results in a success probability of
<span class="math inline">$\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n$</span>, where <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is the number of qubits in the money
state. This is better than my approach here, but if we set <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> to be of modest
size, say <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 10</span>, then this approach will succeed <em>at most</em> 5 times out of
100; still not particularly good. If we had 100 twenty dollar notes, we could
attempt to forge them, and we’d end up with a total of <span class="math inline">2 × 5 × 20 = $200</span> instead of the original <span class="math inline">$2, 000</span> we started with.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>We’ve seen that Wiesner’s original scheme for quantum money doesn’t appear to
be forgable with our first ideas. In the next post we’ll learn about a very
cool technique in quantum mechanics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur%E2%80%93Vaidman_bomb_tester">Elitzur-Vaidman bomb
tester</a>,
and then we’ll see how it can be used to beat Wiesner’s scheme!</p>
