<p>You were born, cried, learned, made friends, and talked to no-one.</p>
<p>You have survived off the land; launched a startup (the best one), managed
thousands of people, and never been able to get a job, no matter what your
resume says or how you change your name.</p>
<p>You have travelled; and you have lived alone, isolated, and cold.</p>
<p>You have been the best and succeeded all your life.</p>
<p>You have failed; only, just missed out, and never tried again.</p>
<p>You made people happy; shown them the best time, given them everything, and
hurt them, taken it all for yourself, and killed them.</p>
<p>You have died after every breath, and before your first.</p>
<p>You have already accomplished everything.</p>
<p>What do you want to do next?</p>
