<p>so there’s a way of framing data-augmentation as a kind of re-shuffling of categories of knowledge</p>
<p>i.e. heres a person, and they’re the same if we rotate them, and so on, so all those images of rotated people are still people</p>
<p>c.f. i just learned that this person is a man, that means all these other people that i didn’t know about are men, and that rules out these people being men, etc …</p>
there’s some kind of strong relation here

<hr />
<p>Unsurprisingly, given my current job, most of the ideas center around deep
learning in some capacity. At a glance, I’d say that at least half of the deep
learning ideas I’ve had have already been completed (in almost all cases not
by me!) so that’s kinda cool. Seems like the next most popular thing to have
an idea about is fashion, which also probably won’t shock you.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus!</strong></p>
<p>Because this is the first time I’ve done this post, here are <em>all</em> the ideas
since the beginning of time:</p>

<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/84">is there a problem with OAuth2 if two providers authenticate the same ident?</a>: say i have an ident on google with foo@gmail.com, then i sign up to another oauth2 provider with that as my username (if allowed). then i could authenticate with either provider. this would be a problem; i.e. idents need to be unique across *every single oauth2 implementor’. i guess this is why you should only allow people to authenticate with a small number of providers, or alternatively identify users in your database by their identifier <em>and</em> the provider, not just the id.

<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/34">calculate number of mistakes one can make</a>: none is bad. two is also a bit arbitrary. it’s probably a function of the ‘class’ of mistake, and whether or not you claim to know how to not make that mistake again, etc. try and calculate what this is.

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/33">some sort of self-organised university thing</a>: where you could declare a set of subjects you will run, and layout some course plan, and then teach yourself those things. the idea would be to just have some structure and way of remembering what you should be doing, and accountability. for some reason it seems fun to perhaps use gitit for this.

</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/26">interactive thesis</a>: write it in a mathematica notebook or an IPython thing; then I can read and interact wtih it.

</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/21">author hash function</a>: calculate a useful hash function that can be queried for closeness when related authors publish stuff together. If it funtions like f(A+B) = f(B+A) then first-authorship no-longer matters. a suggestion is a hash function on a metric space that is also a metric. then the idea is to look at the p-adic’s and some homomorphism.

</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/18">meeting/discussion emulator</a>: a system into which you could place people, and list their standard opinions and responses, and then model how they will interact with another group of people. it could be used to emulate meetings. supposing it emulates meetings well, it could then be used to randomly replace meetings in a given company, thus allowing more time for whatever people normally do.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/17">agree-o-tron</a>: plugin for skype calls, or similar, that instead of videos just captures “agreement”, and indicates as much with a pointer. it determines agreement by processing video, locally, and then sending only what it infers as nodding or disagreeing over the server. would need to be a program that runs independently, perhaps, of skype on the local machine. then sets itself up as a server for the video stream that it is watching; then other people could browse that to get a general idea of the “agreement” in that room.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/16">programming gallery</a>: like an art gallery; but would have particularly nice code examples in it.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/15">invalid premise detector</a>: imagine if it were possible to look at natural language statements and determine an incorrect premise, and have it pointed out. currently it’s not feasible least-of-all because it isn’t possible to programmatically review all statements. but suppose it were (whether or not this is a good idea, it’s becoming more feasible), then it would be possible to consider the existence of such a program. it would look at each statement, and decide whether or not it is justified. for example: s1: “it doesn’t hurt to let people know about standard thing when something new comes along” could be analysed as invalid, because perhaps it is bad, if say the standard things are bad, or similar. i.e. the above statement is only valid with certain assumptions. perhaps alternatively this project could be something like ‘assumptions identifier’; and for each statement it is able to work out the assumptions under which it is valid.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/14">programmers keyboard</a>: there are many ideas like this, but i’m not sure which one i like best. a custom key layout? an actual physical keyboard? a supplemental keyboard to the typical one? a modal keyboard? one idea is to add a new row of keys. This new row would feature specific keys for characters such as: ! ? * &lt; &gt; ( ) { } . ” : + &amp; | . This list could possible be configured for different languages, as some wouldn’t require those characters, and may want different ones (for example Python, or some form of assembly). But at least it may save us from constantly pressing shift, and it may be interesting to see if it can lead to other possible benefits; i.e. what other buttons could be implemented and considered. It may be interesting to consider a ‘build’ button, or attach some macros to ‘programmable’ buttons. It is already known that <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/">programmable keyboards</a> exist, so maybe they are the answer; but they are very expensive. maybe this can all be solved by vim configurations, though (as with many of lifes problems).
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/13">creative idea generator</a>: it should be possible to have a program that generates creative ideas on a given topic. as a first pass it should be able to generate other ‘random-combination’ based ideas that i’ve thought of; much like the ‘lift reading/writing’ above.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/12">lift reading/writing</a>: all lifts could contain fixed whiteboard markers; then you could write on them if you wanted.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/11">note from self</a>: a thing which reads your comments for ‘note to self’ and then randomly tells you about these things. by ‘comments’ i mean any comment anywhere. for example, this app could exist as a skype bot, that joins in on your skype conversations; or alternatively it might go through all your source code, or wherever you write these things. i think it might be best if it responds back in a few ways; i was thinking that it could randomly send a message to your terminal, or again with the skype thing, it could randomly send you a message.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/10">stay up to date with specific authors</a>: There are a couple of things to do this already. - scirate - google scholar alerts I also wrote arxiv-checker (since gone.). I’m not sure if any of these is perfect, though. arxiv-checker is limited in only checking arxiv, and also in the number of people and at the moment only does a month back in time. google scholar occasionally gets it wrong (i get sent alerts when the author didn’t actually publish the paper), and scirate requires you see the paper pop up.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/9">ambient sound interpreter</a>: takes input from the local radio waves, converts them into sound via some pattern matching radom strategy. it should be possible to modify, based on mood, but it should also sound sufficiently unique as to be interesting.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/8">mathematical property browser</a>: suppose you have some object; you’d like to find out what you can do with it. for example, you might have a ‘simple function’. then it could be measureable, say, in the context of measure theory, and so on. can generalise to finding various theorems (and lemmas, etc) that could be used in certain scenarios. should be easy to use; not at the level of proof assistants. things like this: - http://slugmath.ucsc.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page - http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/dke.html - http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/mmset.html
