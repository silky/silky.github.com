<p>I can’t believe I forgot to do this at the start of the year!</p>
<p>Let’s look back over 2018’s ideas:</p>
<h1 id="the-ideas">The Ideas</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/470">using ai to reduce medical dosages</a>: i.e. imagine you need such-and-such amount of radiation in order for certain whatever to be seen in some scan can you lower the dosage and then use some ai technique to enhance the quality of the image?
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/469">something about shape-based reasoning</a>: i.e. the fact that some grammar-parsing problem teems like a good fit for tensor-network works because they both have the “shape” of a tree another example would be thinking of solving a problem of identifying different types of plants as it fits in the “shape” of a classifier but these things could potentially have <em>other</em> shapes? and therefore fit into <em>other</em> kinds of problems?
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/468">a q&amp;a bot that can answer tests on the citizenship test</a>: Q: What is our home girt by? A: ..
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/467">buddhist neural network</a>: it features significant self-attention and self-awareness it performs classification, but predicts the same class for every input as it has a nondual mind it’s loss function features a single term for each of the 6 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81ramit%C4%81">paramitas</a>: - Generosity: to cultivate the attitude of generosity. - Discipline: refraining from harm. - Patience: the ability not to be perturbed by anything. - Diligence: to find joy in what is virtuous, positive or wholesome. - Meditative concentration: not to be distracted. - Wisdom: the perfect discrimination of phenomena, all knowable things.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/466">music-to-image</a>: say you’re listening to greek music you want to generate an image of a singer singing on some clifftop on greece under an olive tree near a vineyard surely a simple matter of deep learning
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/465">code story by word frequency</a>: take all the words in a code repo, order them by frequency, then match that up to some standard book, then remap the code according to the frequency
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/464">generalisation of deutch-jozsa’s problem</a>: here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm generalise it so that we have multiple f’s that have different promises; i.e. i’m constant “50% of the time”. what now?
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/463">analogy-lang</a>: reading https://maetl.net/membrane-oriented-programming by <span class="citation" data-cites="maetl">@maetl</span> i had an idea for a programming language consider two types, “person” and “frog”, let’s say there are at least two problems; one is the one in the article - it’s hard to come up with a complete list of methods/properties that should exactly define one of these things. in surfaces and essences they argue that in reality no categorisation has perfectly defined boundaries; so how to define the types? another problem is what happens if i want to build a thing that is both “person-like” and “frog-like”? you can’t. especially not if the differences are far away (i.e. is frog hopping like “walking”? should it be the implementation of a “walk” method? probably not; but a “move” method? probably? but what about less-clear things? and doesn’t it depend on what your merging with) in this way it seems like it’s impossible to come up with strict types for anything so here’s an idea: analogy-lang: let’s you define types in a much more relaxed way; “this thing is like that thing in these ways, but different in these ways”
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/462">multi-layered network</a>: train some network f to produce y_1 from x_1 f(x_1) = y_1 then, wrap that in a new network, g, that produces y_1 and y_2 from x_1 and x_2 g(x_1, x_2) = ( f(x_1,), g’(x_1, x_2) ) and so on. interesting
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/461">psychadelics for ai</a>: ideas: - locate some kind of “default-mode network” in your model and inhibit it - after training; allow many more connections - have two modes of network; one this “high-entropy” learning one, which prunes down to a more efficient one that can’t learn but can decide quickly
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/460">ultimate notification page</a>: it’s just a page with a bunch of iframes to all your different websites where you get the little notification things and then it just tiles them; showing in-which places you have notifications.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/459">use deep learning to replace a movie character with yourself and your own acting</a>: 1. semantic segmentation to remove an actor 2. film yourself saying their lines 3. plug yourself back into the missing spot 4. dress yourself in the appropriate clothes 5. adjust the lighting 6. ??? 7. profit!
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/458">paramterised papers</a>: “specifically, this model first generates an aligned position p_t for each target word at time t” show me this sentence with t = whatever and p = some dimension
</li>

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/456">use autocomplete and random phrases to guess things about people</a>: “i love you …” find out who they love “give me …” find out what they want and so on
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/455">visualise the difference between streaming and shuffling sampling algorithms</a>: streaming -&gt; for low numbers, misses items shuffling -&gt; for low numbers, bad distribution across indices that are shuffled. <span class="citation" data-cites="dseuss">@dseuss</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="martiningram">@martiningram</span>

</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/452">ai email judgement front</a>: intercepts all your emails for every email, it decides the optimal time that someone will respond it sends it at that time so that they respond

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/444">spacetime calendar</a>: we have calendars for dates but they don’t often contain space constraints so why not a space-time calendar, defined in some kind of light cone?
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/443">app to check consistency of items before you leave</a>: it’s an app you configure it to be aware of your keys, laptop, wallet, glasses then, as you leave your house, it can inform you of the status of those items: - “hey, your computer is at home” - “all g, your glasses are at work” etc <span class="citation" data-cites="gacafe">@gacafe</span>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/442">gradient tug-of-war demonstration</a>: given a function f(x,y) = x + y then if we have competing loss functions then it would be nice to visualise the gradient flow as a tug of war

<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/435">Arbitrary-Task Programming</a>: given that programming is just arranging symbols, <em>and</em> we can use deep learning to interpret the real world into symbols, <em>then</em> it’s possible to do programming by performing arbitrary tasks i.e. <em>any</em> job can be programming, if we can build the deep-learning system that converts actions in that job into symbols in a programming language
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/434">Sitcom-Lang</a>: it’s a pre-processor, or something, for an arbtrariy language whenever a symbol is defined, that symbol is embued with a soul and a “nature”. it starts to have wants and needs; and those must be satisfied in order for it to stay in it’s present form (i.e. as a “for loop”), otherwise it might change (i.e. to be a “while” loop, or maybe even a string instead). all the symbols will interact with each other, and in that way a program will be made <span class="citation" data-cites="sordina">@sordina</span>
