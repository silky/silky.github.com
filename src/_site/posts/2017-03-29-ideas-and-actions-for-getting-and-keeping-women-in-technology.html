<p>In my job I’m almost entirely surrounded by men.</p>
<center>
<img src="../images/silverponders.png" />
</center>
<p>I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="http://silverpond.com.au">Silverpond</a>. It’s definitely the best place I’ve ever worked, but there’s one area that we’re actively trying to improve: recruiting women into roles as software engineers and machine learning engineers.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll cover some ideas I’ve had along these lines.</p>
<h2 id="the-recruiting-side">The Recruiting Side</h2>
<p>When I’ve been involved in recruiting people, in recent history, it’s tended to be almost entirely by word of mouth. My process is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I find out there’s a job available,</li>
<li>I think about the people I know who might be good,</li>
<li>I approach them.</li>
</ol>
<p>This actually works very well, but only because I tend to go to a lot of events, and I meet a lot of people. The one key problem with this approach is: I mostly end up recommending men.</p>
<p>I think that the reason for this can be somewhat explain by various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive biases</a> (notably, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism">Ingroup bias</a>”), and so I’ve been thinking about how to address it.</p>
<p>I was pointed at the few articles along these lines, and I’ll summarise them here:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://malechampionsofchange.com/take-practical-action/avoiding-the-merit-trap/">Avoiding the ‘merit trap’</a></strong> - Chief Executive Women and Male Champions of Change</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: “Merit-based” hiring is correlated with under-representation for diverse teams.</li>
<li>Thoughts:
<ul>
<li>Be aware that any definition of “merit” is somewhat subjective and current-circumstances dependant.</li>
<li>Deciding which qualities are meritable isn’t particularly easy.</li>
<li>This might mean that “puzzle”-based hiring; i.e. “complete this puzzle which when solved gives an email address that you can email for a job” is potentially not a good approach.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Actions:
<ul>
<li>As much as you can, don’t pre-suppose a list of skills and qualities, because your selection is biased to the intersection of skills that your current team has, or that you’ve seen before.</li>
<li>Allow the candidates to express their own individuality in the interviewing process.</li>
<li>Prefer the person that adds something new to the team.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/beginning-with-ourselves/">Beginning with Ourselves</a></strong> - Airbnb</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: Airbnb was didn’t have many women in their data science team; they adjusted their interview process and grew the community, both of which had an impact.</li>
<li>Thoughts:
<ul>
<li>Your interview process can be biased, and it’s probably hard to figure out when that is. If someone tells you, take it seriously.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Actions:
<ul>
<li>Build the community you want to see.</li>
<li>Make your interview process friendly and welcoming to all.</li>
<li>If possible, have a balance of male/female involvement in the interview.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2013/oct/14/blind-auditions-orchestras-gender-bias">How blind auditions help orchestras to eliminate gender bias</a></strong> - The Guardian, and <strong><a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/diversity/2017/how-companies-are-taking-unconscious-bias-out-of-the-hiring-equation">How Companies Are Taking Unconscious Bias Out of the Hiring Equation</a></strong> - LinkedIn Talent Blog</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: If you want to not be biased towards a certain gender, then just keep the gender hidden until they’re employed!</li>
<li>Thoughts:
<ul>
<li>It’s interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying. It wouldn’t help for internal promotions, say. But maybe it’s a useful hack to bootstrap the process.</li>
<li>It’s not practical for me at Silverpond.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Actions:
<ul>
<li>When thinking about a candidate, and making some subjective assesment, think if you would make this same assesment if the gender of the candidate was unknown or switched.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://malechampionsofchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/31.-2011-MCC-report.pdf">Our experiences in elevating the representation of women in leadership</a></strong> - Male Champions of Change</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: Diversity in leadership can be achived by small concrete steps: getting the CEO interested, setting up metrics, building communities and support networks, and reporting on growth and successes achieved as a result of these actions.</li>
<li>Thoughts:
<ul>
<li>This is a very “corporate” article, but contains some good points.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Actions:
<ul>
<li>Convince or demonstrate to the people in charge of hiring that they should become very interested in diversifying the team; without this you will struggle.</li>
<li>Set up mechanisms to track progress numerically.</li>
<li>Set quantitive targets.</li>
<li>Build and support the community you want to see.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Concretely, what I’m going to do in this regard — getting more diverse applicants into the top of our “hiring funnel” — is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Network with a more diverse group; head to events I’ve not been to before,</li>
<li>Improve the messaging on our website around hiring, and write down some statistics that we can start tracking,</li>
<li>Build and support the community.</li>
<li>When thinking about a candidate, and making some subjective assesment, think if I would make this same assesment if the gender of the candidate was unknown or switched.</li>
<li>Don’t pre-suppose an overly-specific list of skills and qualities.</li>
</ol>
<p>and during the interview process, I think the following ideas are useful to keep in mind:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Make sure everyone has an opportunity to feel comfortable,</li>
<li>Allow the candidates to express their own individuality,</li>
<li>Does this person add something new to the team?</li>
<li>Is the job a <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2017/02/16/hiring---opportunity/">cool opportunity</a> for this person?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is kind of a Part-1 of my thoughts on this topic. I’ve had this post sitting in <em>drafts</em> for a while, so I thought I’d publish it. I expressed some related ideas in our <a href="http://silverpond.com.au/2017/03/27/silverponds-diversity-report.html">blog</a>. Let’s see how it progresses over the next few months.</p>
<!--
    - Encouragement
    - Internal/Exerternal actions
    - community building/support
    - differing interests? maybe don't expect pages of github repos
    - passion vs side projects ...
    - changing requirements on men too?
    - ?
