<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>I can’t remember when I first stumbled across <a href="https://scirate.com/">SciRate</a>.</p>
<p>I’d had a fascination with scientific papers
for many years, well before actually attending university (as a mature-age
student) and starting to learn more formally. I would storing them in a
variety of ways, print them out and hang them up in my house; send them to
myself on a mailing list that I created just for that purpose, or a public
subreddit where I would post the papers I wanted to read, so I wouldn’t forget
about them. Evidently, the “bookmarking” feature in the browser wasn’t one I
found particularly useful.</p>
<p>Eventually, I discovered <a href="https://www.jabref.org/">JabRef</a>, which I used for
several years. I stored all the papers that I was interested in (at the time,
quantum computing), and learned all about bibliography management. I even
stored all the PDFs, and the metadata from the JabRef system, in git, horribly
offending bitbuckets storage limits by having a repository ~10GB in size (I
think it doesn’t clone successfully anymore; it’s been several years since
I tried.)</p>
<p>After some time I became tired with JabRef, and built my own (very very
terrible) reference management program: <a href="https://github.com/silky/super-reference">super-reference</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually, I discovered <a href="https://scirate.com/">SciRate</a>. I think the version
I found was called “SciRate 2”. It was in the hands of Bill Rosgen. I got
incredibly excited and signed up immediately. Because the code was open-source
(I actually can’t remember, but I think it might’ve been personally hosted git
repository somewhere), I added possibly one of my first “impactful” changes:
MathJax support! This was neat; now we could see rendered math while reading
abstracts and titles! I think <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> only added this
feature a few years ago.</p>
<p>But, aside from this very minor hacking on the code, I immediately started
finding SciRate actually useful! I could browse it every day; see which papers
would pop up, and track papers I was interested in. Fairly quickly, it became
a very addictive habit for me. I began to learn the time of day that it would
update, and made sure I would scour the website shortly after to browse the
“freshest” papers.</p>
<p>I ended up being completely addicted, and did this for years. I read many
papers (but not every one that I would “scite”); made several nice
connections, and even used my personal SciRate data to teach my first deep
learning workshops. SciRate stuck with my as my interests varied from quantum
computing, theoretical physics, black holes, philosophy, AI, deep learning,
computer vision, generative art, category theory, astrophysics, and the
stranger maths papers. For a while my favourite thing was discovering the
“best paper title” of the week.</p>
<p>The most memorable moment was when, many years later (after the scirate3
re-write), I met people who “knew” me from SciRate, only because they had
seen that I would “scite” a lot of papers (in fact, someone told me that they
didn’t think I was a real person; only a scite-making bot.) To date, <a href="https://scirate.com/noonsilk">I’ve
amassed more than 1 hundred thousand “scites”</a>.
And yes, most of this was done by clicking manually; but in the last year or
two I’ve used a custom program I wrote: <a href="https://github.com/silky/scirate-cli">the
scirate-cli</a>.</p>
<p>In any case, by a very strange coincidence, during my Masters program I
happened to learn that SciRate was undergoing a re-write, amazingly by a
company based in Melbourne (where I lived); just down the road from my
university! I happened to have a conversation with the founder of that
company, <a href="https://bentoner.com/">Ben Toner</a>, relating to my masters project,
but it was a curious connection.</p>
<p>That re-write ended up going, in my view, quite well. But I think, at some
point, it stopped being funded, and fell on the shoulders of
<a href="https://github.com/mispy-archive">mispy</a>. Mispy funded SciRate for a while,
out of their own pocket, until I decided to take it over from them.</p>
<p>That was, now, 5 years ago.</p>
<p>All I’ve really been doing in the mean time is keeping things afloat.
Upgrading the various packages as is required; managing the server, and
the occasional bugfixes.</p>
<p>The only interesting thing I did, in recent times, was to <a href="https://github.com/scirate/scirate/commit/2e7ecbce9ee6db4d70d88597b61b6b2101968ba9">add a “jobs”
feature</a>
to SciRate. This was actually moderately successful, but in the end it was
more effort for me to maintain that it was worth, so I disabled it.</p>
<h4 id="current">Current</h4>
<p>SciRate needs a new maintainer. I’ve decided that, personally, my focus has to
shift elsewhere. You can read about that in the <a href="#addendum">Addendum</a> below.</p>
<p>Here’s what you’ll need to do:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Take ownership of the <a href="https://github.com/scirate/scirate">scirate</a>
repository,</li>
<li>Update the codebase occasionally, maintain deployments, fix the occasional
bug,</li>
<li>Manage the error emails that come in,</li>
<li>Restart the server when it dies,</li>
<li>???</li>
<li><strong>Extend it in interesting ways!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The last one is actually quite important! SciRate has lacked any real new
features for a very long time; but there’s certainly some interesting things
that could be done! Notable among them could be:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scirate/scirate/issues/366">Support for “reading groups”</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scirate/scirate/issues/382">A recommendation engine</a>,</li>
<li>…?</li>
</ul>
<p>The world is (somewhat) your oyster. Clearly there are some rules on how we’d
like SciRate to develop; after all, there is a solid and growing user base,
who have some expectation on how it will operate.</p>
<p>In any case, if you’re interested in getting involved, reach out to
<a href="https://web.mit.edu/aram/www">Aram</a> and myself by sending us an email:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="mailto:noonsilk@gmail.com">noonsilk@gmail.com</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:aram@mit.edu">aram@mit.edu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We’d love to hear from you.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="addendum">Addendum <a name="addendum"></a></h4>
<p>The central reason I’ve decided to stop spending time on SciRate is because of
the climate emergency. I’ve been reading <a href="https://betweenbooks.com.au/tags/climate.html">a lot of
books</a> and it’s become
increasingly important to me to spend my energy learning more and doing more
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">or less!</a>) in this space. If
you’re interested in this too, then please reach out; I’d love to chat!</p>

<p>You were born, cried, learned, made friends, and talked to no-one.</p>
<p>You have survived off the land; launched a startup (the best one), managed
thousands of people, and never been able to get a job, no matter what your
resume says or how you change your name.</p>
<p>You have travelled; and you have lived alone, isolated, and cold.</p>
<p>You have been the best and succeeded all your life.</p>
<p>You have failed; only, just missed out, and never tried again.</p>
<p>You made people happy; shown them the best time, given them everything, and
hurt them, taken it all for yourself, and killed them.</p>
<p>You have died after every breath, and before your first.</p>
<p>You have already accomplished everything.</p>
<p>What do you want to do next?</p>

<p>What is time? How do we measure a life? How many things did you get done
today? What are you working on tomorrow!? Can you come hang out on Sunday!!?</p>
<hr />
<p>Recently, and also always, I’ve been thinking about how to manage a list of
todos. During an internal knowledge-sharing session <a href="https://www.tweag.io/">at

<li><a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas#complete">A whiteboard</a></li>
<li>My head</li>
<li>Nothing</li>
<li>Random pieces of paper</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now I’m back to a whiteboard (by luck I happen to have one behind me
where I work), and ‘todo’ notes in code + github issues.</p>
<hr />
<p>My friend Ruth told me something that perhaps is very obvious but was also
surprisingly calming to me: You’ll die with items on your todo list. So don’t
worry about it!</p>
<p>I think there’s a few ways to think about this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The optimisic view: Amazing that I am lucky enough to have things I intend
to do and look forward to!</li>
<li>The pessimistic view: Sad that I had goals that I was never able to
achieve!</li>
<li>The Buddhist view: Your big mistake is having desires at all!</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to live around option (3) and (1) at the moment, but of course option
(2) is a very very strong driving force; and often necessary (for example, at
work!); the only time I was brave enough to enact option (3) at a work
setting was when <a href="https://braneshop.com.au/posts/Braneshop-A-Living-Business-Part-1.html">I ran my own
business</a>!</p>
<p>Another interesting thing that came up as part of the work discussion was that
in some ways what you want to do depends on your mood. No doubt! So … maybe
mood can be a parameter?!</p>
<hr />
<p>I think, secretly, for the rest of my life, I will believe that there is a True
answer out there; an ultimate organisation scheme; the Four-Fold path to Life
Efficiency: Right Editing, Right Organisation, Right Workflow and Right
History.</p>
<p>But I also think that I should never think about this again. But on the other
hand, I was inspired at the talk today; so I might give task-warrior another
go.</p>
<p>But, you didn’t come here for that! Maybe you came here for advice? So, here
it is (it’s not even my advice! Gala claims it’s her idea which is probably
true):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can, don’t even write the thing down; just do it immediately, or,
alternatively, convince yourself you don’t need to think about it now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe it’s part of my personality, but this works <em>surprisingly</em> well for me.
Especially if it’s something that I’m working on with someone else; instead of
delaying my part, I can just try and make as much progress as I can
immediately, and send it back to the other person! Another way of saying this:
I can offset storing my todo list to you!</p>
<p>I find this idea to be quite operaitonal; I often find myself using this rule
to do something sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Here’s one thing I know about myself: <a href="https://scirate.com/noonsilk">I can’t be trusted with
lists</a>. I get a
bit obsessed with organising them. So I’m trying to avoid them these days.</p>

<p>Continuing the tradition <a href="/posts/2019-01-03-2018-books.html">started in 2018</a>,
continued in 2019 <a href="https://braneshop.com.au/posts/2019-Books.html">over on the Braneshop
blog</a>, I was
reminded I haven’t posted the books I read in 2020 yet.</p>
<p>So, here we are:</p>
<div class="book">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/2020-reading/how-long-til-black-future-month.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/40855636-how-long-til-black-future-month">How Long ’til Black Future Month?</a></strong> by Jemisin, N.K.</p>
<p>As a big fan of N.K. Jemisin I just wanted to read more of what she’d written.
This is good for that; it’s a really nice dip-in to the worlds she has created
and leaves you wanting more!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book alt">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/2020-reading/gravitys-century.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/40010687-gravity-s-century">Gravity’s Century: From Einstein’s Eclipse to Images of Black Holes</a></strong> by Cowen, Ron</p>
<p>Pretty good. This was a nice history of black holes and an introduction to
some of the pressing issues presently.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/2020-reading/the-cloudspotters-guide.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/174372.The_Cloudspotter_s_Guide">The Cloudspotter’s Guide</a></strong> by Pretor-Pinney, Gavin</p>
<p>I picked this up after starting (but not finishing) <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8474155-the-wavewatcher-s-companion">The Wavewatcher’s
Companion</a>,
which I found to be hilarious. This book was not as funny, but was still
pretty good. Gavin has a very nice way of appreciating the world.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book alt">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/2020-reading/altruism.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/22208239-altruism">Altruism: The Power of Compassion to Change Yourself and the World</a></strong> by Ricard, Matthieu</p>
<p>I really quite enjoyed this book, and infact wrote a longer review over on the
<a href="https://betweenbooks.com.au/reviews/2020/altruism-matthieu-ricard-2015.html">Between
Books</a>
website.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book">
<div class="img">

<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/41081373-girl-woman-other">Girl, Woman, Other</a></strong> by Evaristo, Bernardine</p>
<p>A nice collection of stories featuring different women and how their lives
intersect. I think it’s quite nice to get so many stories from the everyday
lives of women; especially for me, for whom it’s a bit unknown territory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book alt">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/2020-reading/the-white-album.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/421.The_White_Album">The White Album</a></strong> by Didion, Joan</p>
<p>The first Joan Didion book I’ve read. She’s very famous of course; and I don’t
know. It was good to read; but was it objectionably good? Maybe. It’s at least
nice to know a bit about her life and how she writes. I’ll probably read more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book">
<div class="img">

<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/17319691-mullumbimby">Mullumbimby</a></strong> by Lucashenko, Melissa</p>
<p>I quite enjoyed this story. It’s also the first time I’ve read a modern
fictional Australian indigenous-centered story. Will be on the look out for
more books of this kind! Came up as part of the <a href="https://ochouse.com.au/">OC
House</a> bookclub, I think.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book alt">
<div class="img">

<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/34640834-down-girl">Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny</a></strong> by Manne, Kate</p>
<p>This book is amazing. I found it to be written in a bit of an academic-y
style; so it can be a bit dense, but it does an amazing job of framing what
misogyny is and how it is present in all aspects of society.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/2020-reading/unfree-speech.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/49964359-unfree-speech">Unfree Speech: The Threat to Global Democracy and Why We Must Act, Now</a></strong> by Wong, Joshua</p>
<p>This is a nice short history of free speech and how China is taking over Hong
Kong. It was interesting to read about how they attempted to make some large
changes to their democracy through grass-roots organisation. In some ways
quite inspiring, but also a reality check that it isn’t easy to defeat power.
Worth a read.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book alt">

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/43783430-a-month-in-siena">A Month in Siena</a></strong> by Matar, Hisham</p>
<p>This was just a nice simple book about someone getting amongst life in a new
town. In many ways I think this kind of experience is how many people wish
their holidays to go: meeting some nice stranger, integrating into the
community, and just appreciating the joy of life.</p>
</div>

<p>I can’t remember much about this book at this point; I think I enjoyed it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book alt">
<div class="img">

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/48503.The_Worst_Journey_in_the_World">The Worst Journey in the World</a></strong> by Cherry-Garrard, Apsley</p>
<p>I read the next two books back-to-back. This one was strange. It’s written
from the English perspective; it’s quite racist at times. I wouldn’t recommend
reading it, unless you really want to compare perspectives on the journeys of
Scott and Amundsen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book">
<div class="img">

<p>This was a really interesting read. It was so fascinating to compare how
Amundsen approached the journey compared to Scott. According to this book,
Scott was woefully underprepared and arrogant, and Amundsen spent many many
years training and learning the right skills from different indigenous groups
in order to survive.</p>
<p>If you want to learn about the race to the south pole; this book is definitely
better than the above.</p>

<p>More of a blog post than a book; but still, nice to keep next to you somewhere
when you want to remember if it’s okay to eat chocolate everyday (probably
not) or have a wine with dinner (probably fine).</p>

overall great.</p>

<p>This one I also enjoyed; I don’t think you really need to read it first before
Ideology, but I opted to do so. Reading this really inspired a love and
interest of economics, and Piketty seems to do an amazing job of exploring
these topics in an approachable way.</p>

<p>This book wasn’t bad; it’s an exploration of life with a marginalised tribe
referred to as the Bushmen. It doesn’t totally take the expected view that the
simple life is better; but it does discuss how politics and the community
encroaches on this tribe, and how they live life.</p>

endurance, and his claim that “anyone” can be like him; in terms of running 7
marathons at the age of 70 across 7 countries; or something along those lines.

during some difficult times, and found it very uplifting.</p>

<p>So, I’m very excited to share that we’re moving overseas! We’re headed to
Cambridge in the UK at the end of this month.</p>
<p>I’m very lucky to be starting work with a very cool quantum computing company:
<a href="https://www.riverlane.com/">Riverlane</a>.</p>
<h2 id="leaving-melbourne">Leaving Melbourne</h2>
<p>It’s going to be interesting leaving Melbourne. I’ve lived here all my life
basically, and I’ve found a really nice group of friends. I’m going to miss
everyone.</p>
<p>I owe a big thanks to <strong>everyone</strong> that’s helped me in my career and life over the
years here. I won’t list all of you, but thanks :) I wouldn’t be where I am if
I hadn’t had your help and support. ❤️ 💖</p>
<p>In particular the meetup community has been a great place for me and somewhere
I was able to forge some really strong friendships. Specifically, I’ve had a
great time at the Melbourne Maths and Science Meetup, the Haskell Meetup, back
in the day I loved MXUG, and of course I have to thank my friend David Kemp
for being the only consistent attendee of the Quantum Lunch, started way back
in the day! I’ll also miss hanging out with the cool people who’ve come to
events I’ve helped organise, such as <a href="https://www.composeconference.org/2016-melbourne/">compose
conference</a> and
<a href="https://postpredictionconference.github.io/">post-prediction conference</a>. I
love Melbourne for the really nice connection you get between different
communities, and it’s been some of my favourite times meeting people from
outside my standard little bubble.</p>
<p>I also have to thank my friend Charles Hill from Melbourne University, who
taught me so much about quantum computing, is an amazing researcher and
very kind and generous person.</p>
<p>Thanks also to the other people in the tech community here that have supported
me and helped me first move into new jobs and learn interesting and fun
things. I’ve been very lucky.</p>
<p>Of course, thanks again to all the people that helped out with
<a href="https://braneshop.com.au/">Braneshop</a> whom I’ve already mentioned over there.</p>
<h2 id="cambridge">Cambridge</h2>
<p>We’re totally new to Cambridge, so if you’ve got suggestions/connections I’d
love to hear about it! Definitely keen to meet some people and get into the
community over there.</p>
<p><strong>Reach out if you like!</strong></p>
<p>I’ve benefited a lot from emailing random people and just asking questions,
so please feel free to reach out to me if you think I can help with
anything!</p>

<p>Inspired by this recent paper - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14258.pdf">Towards decolonising computational
sciences</a> - I thought it might be a nice
idea to write down a list of privileges that I can identify I have. I’ll
probably update this list as I think of them.</p>
<p>My list:</p>
<ul>
<li>White, Male, Cisgendered: I don’t often feel out of place.</li>
<li>Healthy: Nothing has prevented me from finding work.</li>
<li>Able-bodied: Getting around is easy.</li>
<li>Somewhat extroverted: Able to engage and network somewhat easily when I want to.</li>
<li>No dependants: Freedom to move around and spend time as I wish.</li>
<li>Financial stability from a young age: Able to take (moderate) risks.</li>
<li>Supportive parent: I know I’ll have a place to go.</li>
<li>Supportive partner: Financial/emotional support to experiment.</li>
<li>Live close to the city: Access to events, convenience.</li>
<li>Good mental health: I’m able to focus when I want; am most of the time moderately calm.</li>
<li>Language: I speak English natively.</li>
<li>Exposed to tech from a young age: I had a computer in the house since I was
young, and was able to learn programming on my own as a result.</li>
<li>Well-educated: I went to a private school, and was eventually able to attend
good universities and get access to experts and knowledge in this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>These things have helped me get jobs in the past. Some of them are
traits that you can improve, as well as baseline things thare are out of my
control to some degree (i.e. mental health; certainly it can be improved, but
certainly it’s not all my doing.)</p>
<p>I also found this: <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/u.boisestate.edu/social-justice-training/about-us/our-training/privilege-checklist">Privilege
Checklist</a> from this <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/u.boisestate.edu/social-justice-training/home">Social Justice Training</a> program, that is a very good starting point for building a comprehensive list. This feels like a great exercise for teams to get together and think about.</p>
<p>What’s your list?</p>

<p>I can’t believe I forgot to do this at the start of the year!</p>
<p>Let’s look back over 2018’s ideas:</p>
<h1 id="the-ideas">The Ideas</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/470'>using ai to reduce medical dosages</a>: i.e. imagine you need such-and-such amount of radiation in order for certain whatever to be seen in some scan can you lower the dosage and then use some ai technique to enhance the quality of the image?
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/469'>something about shape-based reasoning</a>: i.e. the fact that some grammar-parsing problem teems like a good fit for tensor-network works because they both have the “shape” of a tree another example would be thinking of solving a problem of identifying different types of plants as it fits in the “shape” of a classifier but these things could potentially have <em>other</em> shapes? and therefore fit into <em>other</em> kinds of problems?
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/468'>a q&amp;a bot that can answer tests on the citizenship test</a>: Q: What is our home girt by? A: ..
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/467'>buddhist neural network</a>: it features significant self-attention and self-awareness it performs classification, but predicts the same class for every input as it has a nondual mind it’s loss function features a single term for each of the 6 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81ramit%C4%81">paramitas</a>: - Generosity: to cultivate the attitude of generosity. - Discipline: refraining from harm. - Patience: the ability not to be perturbed by anything. - Diligence: to find joy in what is virtuous, positive or wholesome. - Meditative concentration: not to be distracted. - Wisdom: the perfect discrimination of phenomena, all knowable things.
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/466'>music-to-image</a>: say you’re listening to greek music you want to generate an image of a singer singing on some clifftop on greece under an olive tree near a vineyard surely a simple matter of deep learning
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/465'>code story by word frequency</a>: take all the words in a code repo, order them by frequency, then match that up to some standard book, then remap the code according to the frequency
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/464'>generalisation of deutch-jozsa’s problem</a>: here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm generalise it so that we have multiple f’s that have different promises; i.e. i’m constant “50% of the time”. what now?
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/463'>analogy-lang</a>: reading https://maetl.net/membrane-oriented-programming by <span class="citation" data-cites="maetl">@maetl</span> i had an idea for a programming language consider two types, “person” and “frog”, let’s say there are at least two problems; one is the one in the article - it’s hard to come up with a complete list of methods/properties that should exactly define one of these things. in surfaces and essences they argue that in reality no categorisation has perfectly defined boundaries; so how to define the types? another problem is what happens if i want to build a thing that is both “person-like” and “frog-like”? you can’t. especially not if the differences are far away (i.e. is frog hopping like “walking”? should it be the implementation of a “walk” method? probably not; but a “move” method? probably? but what about less-clear things? and doesn’t it depend on what your merging with) in this way it seems like it’s impossible to come up with strict types for anything so here’s an idea: analogy-lang: let’s you define types in a much more relaxed way; “this thing is like that thing in these ways, but different in these ways”
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/462'>multi-layered network</a>: train some network f to produce y_1 from x_1 f(x_1) = y_1 then, wrap that in a new network, g, that produces y_1 and y_2 from x_1 and x_2 g(x_1, x_2) = ( f(x_1,), g’(x_1, x_2) ) and so on. interesting
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/461'>psychadelics for ai</a>: ideas: - locate some kind of “default-mode network” in your model and inhibit it - after training; allow many more connections - have two modes of network; one this “high-entropy” learning one, which prunes down to a more efficient one that can’t learn but can decide quickly
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/460'>ultimate notification page</a>: it’s just a page with a bunch of iframes to all your different websites where you get the little notification things and then it just tiles them; showing in-which places you have notifications.
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/459'>use deep learning to replace a movie character with yourself and your own acting</a>: 1. semantic segmentation to remove an actor 2. film yourself saying their lines 3. plug yourself back into the missing spot 4. dress yourself in the appropriate clothes 5. adjust the lighting 6. ??? 7. profit!
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/458'>paramterised papers</a>: “specifically, this model first generates an aligned position p_t for each target word at time t” show me this sentence with t = whatever and p = some dimension
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/457'>on a slide-deck, have a little small game that plays out in a tiny section of each slide</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/456'>use autocomplete and random phrases to guess things about people</a>: “i love you …” find out who they love “give me …” find out what they want and so on
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/455'>visualise the difference between streaming and shuffling sampling algorithms</a>: streaming -&gt; for low numbers, misses items shuffling -&gt; for low numbers, bad distribution across indices that are shuffled. <span class="citation" data-cites="dseuss">@dseuss</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="martiningram">@martiningram</span>
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/454'>symbolic tensorflow</a>: so i can do convs and explain them really easily
</li>
<li>

<p>I’ve seen a few people post the books that they’ve read over the last year; so
I thought I’d also get in on the action. Here are the books that I read (or
partially read), in no particular order, last year:</p>
<h3 id="non-fiction">Non-Fiction</h3>
<div class="book">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/books-2018/oregon.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/616875.The_Oregon_Experiment">The Oregon Experiment</a></strong>
by Christopher W. Alexander, Murray Silverstein, Shlomo Angel, Sara Ishikawa, Denny Abrams</p>
<p>Anyone that knows me, knows that Christopher Alexander is basically my
personal Jesus. This book is amazing, to me in it’s demonstration of
Alexander’s (and collaborators) standard approach to architecture; i.e
building via small local activities in an endless cycle according to a
specific and developing pattern language. It also contains very important
insights, in my mind, in terms of project management and <a href="/posts/2018-11-09-quick-note-on-budgeting.html">budgeting</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book alt">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/books-2018/educated.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated">Educated</a></strong>
by Tara Westover</p>
<p>I learned about this one from <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Educated">Bill
Gates</a>. It’s amazing. I found it
really fascinating to read about Tara’s life, and how she understood her
upbringing. It makes you think quite a lot about the things you tell yourself
to make sense of the situations you’re in.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/books-2018/darkemu.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21401526-dark-emu">Dark Emu</a></strong>
by Bruce Pascoe</p>
<p>Soon to be (if not already) an Australian classic; it’s very interesting to
learn an entirely different history about our country and the Aboriginal
people. I found it to be reasonably hard reading because there are some solid
descriptions of various items and processes that it would’ve been amazing to
have pictures of. In any case, necessary reading.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book alt">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/books-2018/candor.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939161-radical-candor">Radical Candor</a></strong>
by Kim Malone Scott</p>
<p>I basically hated this book. I think, on the one hand, it <em>does</em> have useful
information in it; but for me it came across too much like standard Silicon
Valley propoganda. I do think there is good stuff in here, for leaders that
struggle with feedback.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/books-2018/citiesforpeople.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8556291-cities-for-people">Cities for People</a></strong>
by Jan Gehl</p>
<p>Recommended to me by Ryan, who was working as a Barista at from <a href="https://www.streat.com.au/">Streat</a>,
this book is, apparently, a classic of urban planning. It’s amazing. It has a
incredibly readable style; with lots of pictures and summaries of each
paragraph. Jan has had a lot of impact in designing Melbourne, so it’s really
interesting to read this book and see and understand the impact he and his
team have had.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book alt">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/books-2018/factfulness.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness">Factfulness</a></strong>
by Hans Rosling, Ola Rosling, Anna Rosling Rönnlund</p>
<p>Quite good. From this book I learned about the website <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/">Dollar
Street</a>, which is incredible and
well worth a visit. Hans has many questions in the book; almost all of which I
answered wrong, much like most of his audience that he’s asked the questions
to. I learned a lot about how to think about world-wide progress, and that
there are interesting organisations out there doing interesting work. I also
learned, much to my surprise, that the World Bank isn’t a bank in the sense
that I would’ve assumed; it’s main goal is to end poverty!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/books-2018/enlightenment.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35696171-enlightenment-now">Enlightenment Now</a></strong>
by Steven Pinker</p>
<p>Not bad. This is the first book of Steven Pinker I’ve read. I’m unlikely to
read more, after learning about some sexist views he’s had from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8031168-delusions-of-gender">Delusions of
Gender</a> (not a
book I’ve read yet; but heard thoughts from my partner).</p>
<p>I found this book to be reasonably good, and make some solid arguments for
continuing to fight against people that don’t think progress is real.
Unfortunately, to paraphrase a joke from the Simposns, Steven seems like the
kind of person that can use graphs to prove anything that is even remotely
true. It contains too many anecdotes and cherry-picked examples.</p>
<p>I’d recommend Factfulness over this one.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book alt">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/books-2018/trees.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28256439-the-hidden-life-of-trees">The Hidden Life of
Trees</a></strong>
by Peter Wohlleben</p>
<p>Really great. I’ve always been a bit of a hippie, and am mostly vegetarian, so when
my partner found out I’d be reading this one, she started to get a bit concerned that
I’d soon not even eat greens! Now, I haven’t quite gone that far, but I do really love
the ideas and science in this book; and I think it’s really interesting to think of
trees and their root-systems as being some giant entity. The one downside to this book
is that it occasionally lacks pictures of the concepts that are being described.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/books-2018/surfaces.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7711871-surfaces-and-essences">Surfaces and Essences</a></strong>
by Douglas R. Hofstadter, Emmanuel Sander</p>
<p>Amazing. Probably not for people feeling a bit impatient. The book goes into many
examples of the ideas; and makes a strong argument for the idea that all thinking
is based on analogies. I’ve always loved analogies, so I’m naturally a big fan.</p>
<p>As someone presently working in AI, I found this book full of many incredibly
interesting and relevant ideas; one of which we discussed
<a href="/posts/2018-06-16-when-will-google-translate-be-great.html">previously</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re at all interested in when computers might be able to get
to think like humans, definitely have a read!</p>
</div>

<div class="book alt">
<div class="img">

<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32895535-why-buddhism-is-true">Why Buddhism is True</a></strong>
by Robert Wright</p>
<p>Amazing. Recommended to me by my friend Julia. Probably one of the best books
I’ve ever read, really; right up there with Christopher Alexander’s “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3131171-the-nature-of-order">Nature of
Order</a>” and
“<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106728.The_Timeless_Way_of_Building">The Timeless Way of
Building</a>”.
This book is particularly neat, of course, because it takes a scientific
approach to making sense of buddhist ideas. Overall, I find lots of agreement
between this book, and the ideas of Christopher Alexander, and Surfaces and
Essences.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book">

</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31869108-inferior">Inferior</a></strong>
by Angela Saini</p>
<p>Pretty interesting. In this book Angela debunks many myths about the supposed
biological differences between men and women. This is the first book of this
kind that I’ve read; it won’t be the last.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book alt">

<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821053-how-adam-smith-can-change-your-life">How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life</a></strong>
by Russ Roberts</p>
<p>I read this because my partners dad had it in the house. It’s pretty good;
it’s really interesting to see the thoughts from someone from so far back in
history. For me, this book resonated with the ideas I read in “Why Buddhism is
True”. Worth reading if you happen upon it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/books-2018/siddartha.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11510916-siddartha">Siddartha</a></strong>
by Hermann Hesse</p>
<p>I was not a fan of this. Recommended to me by my partner; I found it to be way
too “on the nose” about enlightenment. I felt like I was being dragged around
to understand certain things, in an obliquely mystical way. Maybe it’s because
I read it after I read Why Buddhism is True; which is much more direct and
scientific.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book alt">

<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40611510-the-last-lecture">The Last Lecture</a></strong>
by Randy Pausch</p>
<p>Quite good; but quite “American”. If you don’t like too much american-style
dreams of success and culture, you might not like this. There’s also the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">video
of the talk that inspired it</a> that
is well worth watching.</p>
<p>I watched the video way back in the day; and thought I’d finally read the book.
I wasn’t disappointed, but I’m not sure I got much new out of the book that I
didn’t get out of the talk. Still, worth grabbing if you got something out of
the talk.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/books-2018/big-picture.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26150770-the-big-picture">The Big Picture</a></strong>
by Sean Carroll</p>
<p>Not great. Before I’d read this, I really had thought I liked Sean Carroll.
But, this book comes across to me as very arrogant. As someone who’s read way
too many popular physics books, it contained a fair amount that wasn’t new to
me (but that’s okay), but also a fair amount of just plain arrogance about what
is known, where we can expect progress and what areas are accessible to
science.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book alt">
<div class="img">
<img src="/images/books-2018/lost-connections.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34921573-lost-connections">Lost Connections</a></strong>
by Johann Hari</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this. I’ve also suffered (mild, I think) depression, and can
really relate to the ideas in this book; namely making connections with people. Probably

<p>Not bad. Fairly introductory thoughts on the topic, but from someone working in
policy on this area. Nice to see an Australian view on these issues. Worth reading
it you want a broad overview.</p>

<p>This is okay. I get very frustrated these days by books that are implicitly sexist; using
language like “when man discovered this”, etc, and this book does that a fair bit. I think
I was hoping for this to answer more questions than it did; or to be a bit more detailed. I
think I probably just misjudged the intended audience.</p>

<p>Pretty good. I haven’t read much about neuroscience, and I am really mostly
confused about the physics of time, and problems like the so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time">arrow of
time</a>”, and such. So I found this
to be pretty interesting, and have some good ideas in it that I hadn’t thought
about, such as different “clocks” in the body for different purposes.</p>

<p>Interesting, but odd. I found this book to be worthwhile reading; in particular because it
lead me to some interesting ideas around the <a href="/posts/2018-07-25-ethics-of-AI.html">ethics of AI</a>.
Cris goes into weird details of empathy in use in businesses, and life. Overall, worth taking

<p>Great. Never having taken psychadelics myself, and basically having the view that they
are a bit dangerous, this book totally changed my mind. I found it totally fascinating,
alongside Why Buddhism is True, in terms of a potential path towards enlightenment. It’s
certainly interesting to learn about the history of psychadelic drugs, and think about the
connection to mindful meditation.</p>

by Christopher Alexander</p>
<p>Incredible. As we learned at the start, Christopher Alexander is my personal Jesus and this
set of books is essentially his bible. As a result, this is amazing reading for
me. He describes what it means for something to “have life”; he goes into detail
by way of examples, a mathematical model, and a practical, hands-on theory. He
breaks it down into what he refers to as “centers”; things that build on each
other.</p>

<p>Amazing. I’m only part of the way through this book, but I love it. We saw Mariana talk
at some event a few weeks ago; and she’s an amazing speaker with a incredibly ability
to talk with enthusiasm about complicated ideas.</p>
<p>This book is all about “value” vs “price”; and what industries should be considered “productive”
in how they contributed to the economoy. In particular it’s really opened my eyes about the
finance industry. Amazing reading.</p>

relax you.</p>
