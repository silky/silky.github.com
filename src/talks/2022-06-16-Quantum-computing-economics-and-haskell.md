summary:
  Money. Why work for it, if you could but simply obtain it once, replicate
  it, and use it an unlimited number of times? Aside from the systemic
  economic fallout that would result, a practical issue is that most physical
  currency has built-in protections to make this difficult, but if movies are
  anything to go by, itâ€™s not impossible. But, is there a way to make currency
  impossible to counterfeit? And if so, what could that possibly have to do
  with functional programming or quantum computing? Find out in this talk as
  we take a tour this connection, from working out what quantum money is, then
  breaking it, then connecting it to Haskell via type theory, and finally
  concluding with a few open questions and interesting ideas in the space!
